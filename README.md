# At-Risk Youth Group Home Web Application 

A project inspired by the disorganization of a group home that a teammember's relative works at. Group homes have many professionals involved; however, the application allows for three professionals to share data involving a youth at risk. The user types are: youth worker, psychologist, and pediatrician. Each user type is able to create a "document" which involves inputting data into the user's corresponding HTML form. Every time a document is created, a share code is generated and the user is able to share their document with another user. Each document is data viewed within an HTML table. We designed the database using an Extended Entity-Relationship Model (EERD) and Relational Model (RM). The application was implemented with Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, JSON, and MySQL. The application has a REST API that uses JSON which is a similar format to a Python dictionary.
